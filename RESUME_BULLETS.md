## Interview Talking Points

### 1. Project Overview
**Question**: "Tell me about this project"

**Answer**:
> "I built an end-to-end skin lesion classifier using PyTorch and the HAM10000 dataset—that's 10,000+ real dermatoscopic images across 7 diagnostic categories like melanoma, melanocytic nevi, and basal cell carcinoma.
> 
> I used EfficientNet_B0 with transfer learning and achieved 79.8% accuracy. What's unique is I implemented Grad-CAM for explainability, so clinicians can see which image regions influenced the prediction—this is crucial for medical AI trust and adoption.
> 
> I optimized it with mixed precision training for my RTX GPU, getting 2-3x speedup. The full stack includes a Streamlit frontend with real-time inference, comprehensive pytest suite with 10/10 passing tests, and it's deployed on Hugging Face Spaces."

### 2. Technical Challenges
**Q**: "What was the biggest technical challenge?"

**A**: "The dataset has severe class imbalance—67% of images are benign melanocytic nevi. I addressed this with stratified sampling to prevent data leakage (same lesion in train/test), heavy data augmentation (rotation, color jitter), and monitored macro F1-score instead of just accuracy to ensure the model performs well on minority classes like dermatofibroma (only 115 images)."

### 3. Architecture Choices
**Q**: "Why EfficientNet over ResNet or other architectures?"

**A**: "EfficientNet_B0 offers the best accuracy-to-parameters ratio. It's 5x smaller than ResNet-50 (5M vs 25M params) but achieves similar accuracy. This matters for deployment—faster inference, lower memory, and easier to deploy on edge devices. Plus, it's specifically designed with compound scaling, so I can easily scale up to EfficientNet-B3/B4 if I get more data."

### 4. Explainability (XAI)
**Q**: "What's Grad-CAM and why did you implement it?"

**A**: "Grad-CAM is Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping—an explainability technique that visualizes which image regions contributed most to the model's prediction. For medical AI, this is critical because clinicians need to trust the model. If Grad-CAM highlights a suspicious mole correctly, it validates the model's reasoning. If it highlights the wrong region, we know the model is making predictions for the wrong reasons. I implemented it from scratch using PyTorch hooks on the last convolutional layer."

### 5. Data Handling
**Q**: "How did you preprocess the HAM10000 dataset?"

**A**: "I wrote a custom preprocessing script that handles HAM10000's unique structure—images are split across two folders (part_1, part_2) and linked via metadata CSV. I performed stratified splitting by lesion_id to prevent data leakage, since the same lesion can have multiple images. The split is 70/15/15 for train/val/test, and I applied Albumentations for augmentation—rotation, horizontal flip, color jitter, and random crop. This helps the model generalize better and handles the class imbalance."

### 6. GPU Optimization
**Q**: "How did you optimize for GPU performance?"

**A**: "I implemented mixed precision training using PyTorch's Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). This uses float16 for forward/backward passes and float32 for weight updates, giving 2-3x speedup on modern NVIDIA GPUs with Tensor Cores. I also added dynamic batch size reduction to handle OOM errors gracefully. Training 30 epochs on 10K images takes about 45 minutes on my RTX 4060."

### 7. Testing & Validation
**Q**: "How did you validate the model?"

**A**: "I used stratified 70/15/15 split to maintain class distribution. I monitored multiple metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score per class, confusion matrix, and macro F1 as the primary metric since it treats all classes equally. I also wrote a comprehensive pytest suite covering dataset loading, transforms, inference pipeline, and Grad-CAM generation. All 10/10 tests pass."

### 8. Deployment
**Q**: "How would you deploy this to production?"

**A**: "For production, I'd:
1. Containerize with Docker for reproducibility
2. Use TorchServe or FastAPI for model serving with batch inference
3. Add Redis caching for repeat predictions
4. Implement structured logging (Prometheus metrics)
5. Add confidence thresholding and human-in-the-loop for low-confidence predictions
6. Deploy on Kubernetes for auto-scaling

For my portfolio demo, I deployed on Hugging Face Spaces—it's free and perfect for showcasing to recruiters."

### 9. Improvements & Future Work
**Q**: "What would you improve if you had more time/resources?"

**A**: 
- **Model**: Try EfficientNet-B3, ensemble with ResNet/DenseNet, add focal loss for class imbalance
- **Data**: Collect more minority class samples, external validation on different datasets
- **Explainability**: Add uncertainty quantification (MC Dropout), SHAP values, attention mechanisms
- **Deployment**: Add A/B testing, drift detection, feedback loop for continuous learning
- **Compliance**: If going to production, work with regulatory consultants for FDA/CE-MDR approval

### 10. Class Imbalance Strategy
**Q**: "How did you handle the 67% class imbalance?"

**A**: "Multiple strategies:
1. **Stratified sampling**: Maintains class distribution in train/val/test
2. **Data augmentation**: Heavy augmentation for minority classes
3. **Macro F1-score**: Primary metric—treats all classes equally
4. **Monitoring per-class metrics**: Track precision/recall for each class

If I had more time, I'd add focal loss (focuses on hard examples) and class-weighted sampling during training."

## Behavioral Interview Answers

### "Why did you build this project?"
> "I wanted to gain hands-on experience with medical AI and explainability. Skin cancer detection is a real-world problem with high impact—early detection saves lives. I also wanted to demonstrate end-to-end ML engineering skills: data handling, GPU optimization, model development, explainability, testing, and deployment. This project showcases skills that FAANG companies look for: PyTorch, computer vision, production patterns, and responsible AI."

### "What did you learn from this project?"
> "Three key learnings:
1. **Class imbalance is hard**: You can't just optimize accuracy—need stratified sampling, macro F1, per-class monitoring
2. **Explainability matters**: Grad-CAM revealed cases where the model focused on artifacts (rulers, skin markings) instead of lesions—this drove me to improve data preprocessing
3. **GPU optimization is a multiplier**: Mixed precision training gave 2-3x speedup with minimal code changes—this makes iteration much faster"

### "How does this relate to the role you're applying for?"
> "This project demonstrates the full ML lifecycle you'd see at [Company]:
- **Data engineering**: Handling messy real-world data (HAM10000 split across folders)
- **Model development**: Transfer learning, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation
- **Production patterns**: Modular code, testing, error handling, checkpointing
- **Deployment**: Streamlit app with real-time inference
- **Responsible AI**: Explainability for high-stakes medical decisions

If I join [Company], I'd bring this same end-to-end thinking to [specific product/team]."

## Common Follow-Up Questions

**Q**: "Have you worked with larger datasets?"  
**A**: "HAM10000 is 10K images (5.2GB). I'm comfortable scaling to larger datasets—I designed the DataLoader with parallel workers and prefetching. For datasets that don't fit in memory, I'd use memory-mapped arrays or streaming dataloaders."

**Q**: "What about model deployment at scale?"  
**A**: "For my demo, I used Streamlit on Hugging Face Spaces. For production at scale, I'd use TorchServe or FastAPI with batch inference, containerize with Docker, deploy on Kubernetes for auto-scaling, add Redis caching, and use Prometheus for monitoring."

**Q**: "How would you monitor this model in production?"  
**A**: "I'd track:
1. **Prediction metrics**: Confidence distribution, per-class counts
2. **Performance**: Inference latency (p50, p95, p99)
3. **Data drift**: Compare input distribution vs training data
4. **Model drift**: Track accuracy over time with human-labeled feedback
5. **Errors**: Log failed predictions, OOM errors, timeout

Use Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and PagerDuty for alerts."

**Q**: "What's your experience with cloud platforms?"  
**A**: "For this project, I used local GPU (RTX 4060) and Hugging Face Spaces for demo. I'm familiar with AWS/Azure/GCP from coursework and side projects. For production ML, I'd use:
- **AWS**: SageMaker for training, Lambda for inference, S3 for data
- **Azure**: Azure ML, AKS for deployment
- **GCP**: Vertex AI, Cloud Run

Happy to learn whichever your team uses."
