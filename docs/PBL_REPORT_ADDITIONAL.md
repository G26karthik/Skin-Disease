## 1. Introduction

This project, titled **AI-Assisted Dermatological Decision Support System (DSS)**, aims to develop a research-grade artificial intelligence tool for automated classification of dermatoscopic skin lesion images. The primary problem addressed is the early and accurate detection of skin cancer and other dermatological conditions using deep learning, with a focus on clinical interpretability and reliability. The system is designed to classify images into seven clinically relevant categories (e.g., Melanoma, Benign Nevus) and provide visual explanations for its predictions.

The motivation for this project stems from the need for scalable, accurate, and explainable AI tools in medical diagnostics, particularly in dermatology where early detection of malignant lesions can significantly improve patient outcomes. The expected outcome is a robust, production-ready AI system that demonstrates high accuracy, strong calibration, and transparent decision-making suitable for academic research, portfolio demonstration, and future clinical translation.

## 2. System Design

### System Architecture
The DSS project follows a modular AI pipeline:
- **Data Ingestion**: Raw dermatoscopic images are loaded from the HAM10000 dataset, organized into train, validation, and test splits with strict lesion-level partitioning to prevent data leakage.
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels, normalized using ImageNet statistics, and optionally augmented (flip, rotate, color jitter) to improve generalization.
- **Model Training**: The core model is EfficientNet_B0, fine-tuned on the HAM10000 dataset using mixed precision (AMP) for speed and memory efficiency. Training is performed for 30 epochs with early stopping and checkpointing.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using accuracy, macro F1-score, calibration metrics (ECE, Brier score), and per-class metrics. Confusion matrices and reliability diagrams are generated for interpretability.
- **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed via a Streamlit web application, allowing users to upload images and receive instant predictions with Grad-CAM visual explanations.

### Modules
- **Data Preparation**: Scripts for dataset preprocessing, stratified splitting, and augmentation.
- **Model Building**: Modular code for constructing EfficientNet_B0 with a custom classification head.
- **Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Configurable training loop supporting AMP, learning rate scheduling, and batch size adjustment.
- **Testing & Evaluation**: Automated scripts for generating metrics, confusion matrices, and calibration plots.
- **Explainability**: Grad-CAM implementation for visualizing model attention.
- **Deployment**: Streamlit app for real-time inference and user interaction.

### Backend Design
- **Storage**: Model weights, metrics, and visualizations are stored in organized directories (`models/`, `runs/`, `docs/images/`).
- **APIs**: The Streamlit app serves as the primary interface; no external cloud APIs are used, ensuring privacy and local processing.

### Architecture Flow (Textual Description)
The system processes an input image as follows:
1. Image is loaded and preprocessed.
2. EfficientNet_B0 backbone extracts features and produces class logits.
3. Softmax converts logits to probabilities; calibration metrics are computed.
4. Grad-CAM generates a heatmap overlay for interpretability.
5. Output includes predicted class, probabilities, heatmap, and latency metrics.
