**Training Status**: Complete (30 epochs, 17,036 images, 85.77% test accuracy)

Audience: 
- Primary: Professor of AI / Academic Evaluator (demonstrates applied ML lifecycle & rigor)
- Secondary: Non‚ÄëAI / Non‚ÄëIT Stakeholders (explains purpose, value, and safe limitations in plain language)

## 1. What Is This Application?
A research-grade prototype that classifies dermatoscopic skin lesion images into 7 clinically relevant categories (e.g., Melanoma, Benign Nevus) and provides visual explanations (Grad‚ÄëCAM heatmaps) plus calibration quality indicators. It is NOT a medical device; it is an educational / exploratory system.

Plain Language: You upload a close-up skin lesion image (from a medical dermatoscope). The system predicts which type it might be and highlights the region it used to decide, helping a future doctor-in-the-loop make a more informed judgment.

## 2. How It Runs (High-Level Flow)
1. Image Loaded ‚Üí resized to 224√ó224 and normalized (ImageNet stats).
2. Model (EfficientNet_B0 backbone) produces class logits.
3. Softmax converts logits to probabilities (calibrated quality assessed via ECE + Brier score).
4. Grad-CAM generates an attention heatmap overlay for interpretability.
5. Output bundle: Top class prediction, per-class probabilities, heatmap, latency metrics (for profiling only in this prototype).

## 3. Resources & Environment
| Resource | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Dataset | HAM10000 (10k dermatoscopic images) |
| Hardware (training) | Single GPU (RTX 4060 Laptop GPU) |
| Framework | PyTorch (2.7.1+cu118) |
| Image Size | 224√ó224 |
| Batch Size (prototype) | 32 |
| Precision | Mixed (AMP) |
| Storage Artifacts | `models/`, `runs/`, `docs/images/` |

---
## 4. Tech Stack
| Layer | Tool | Rationale |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Core DL | PyTorch | Flexible + AMP support |
| Vision Models | torchvision EfficientNet_B0 | Strong accuracy/compute trade-off |
| Data Augmentation | (basic transforms; Albumentations planned) | Improve generalization |
| Visualization | Matplotlib / Seaborn | Reproducible figures |
| Explainability | Custom Grad-CAM | Clinical interpretability baseline |
| Calibration Metrics | Custom ECE + Brier script | Reliability assessment |
| Automation | GitHub Actions | CI reproducibility |

---
## 5. Algorithms & Evolution Path
| Stage | Approach | Reason | Potential Next Step |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Initial Baseline | Pretrained EfficientNet_B0 + linear head | Small, efficient, good start | Hyperparameter tuning / longer training |
| Explainability | Grad-CAM over final conv layer | Fast, widely accepted in medical imaging | Add SHAP, LIME, counterfactuals |
| Calibration | Raw softmax probs + post-hoc ECE/Brier evaluation | Measure trustworthiness | Apply temperature scaling |
| Performance Profiling | Latency + throughput script | Determine clinical feasibility | Batch inference, ONNX / TensorRT |
| Reliability Diagram | Bin-based ECE visualization | Visual miscalibration inspection | Adaptive binning / isotonic regression |

Why EfficientNet_B0: Balanced accuracy vs. parameter count; quick iteration in educational setting. 
Why not start with ViT / Large CNN: Data scale (10k images) insufficient to unlock transformer gains without heavy augmentation; risk of overfitting and longer training cycles.

---
## 6. Rationale for Choices
| Decision | Alternative | Why Chosen |
|----------|------------|------------|
| EfficientNet_B0 | ResNet50 / ViT-B/16 | Similar or better accuracy with fewer FLOPs |
| Grad-CAM | SHAP (CNN), LIME | Faster, first-step interpretability (foundation for expansion) |
| Mixed Precision | Full FP32 | 2‚Äì3√ó faster, lower memory; no accuracy drop observed |
| Lesion-level Splitting | Random image split | Prevents data leakage (same lesion in train & val) |
| Macro F1 Tracking | Accuracy only | Captures minority class performance important for clinical risk |
| ECE + Brier | Accuracy/confusion only | Probabilities must be reliable for clinical triage |

## 12. Limitations (Honest Disclosure)
- **Training Scope**: Completed full 30-epoch training on combined train+validation dataset (17,036 images), but external validation on diverse datasets still needed.
- **Dataset Diversity**: HAM10000 lacks broad skin tone diversity (risk of fairness gaps in real-world deployment).
- **Regulatory Status**: No regulatory processes initiated‚ÄîNOT for clinical decisions despite strong performance.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: No advanced uncertainty estimation yet (only point probabilities with calibration metrics).
- **Explainability Depth**: Grad-CAM provides good baseline interpretability but may need SHAP/LIME for audit-grade transparency.
- **Real-world Factors**: Model trained on controlled dermoscopic images; performance on varied real-world conditions unknown.
